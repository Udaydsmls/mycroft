# Market Sentiment Analysis - Part 1

> **Status basis.** All six step scripts exist and run end to end over the frozen sample
> corpus, both the clean and the defective set. Conformance passes, audits are generated and
> read, and gates 1–4 carry logged decisions in `logs/gate-decisions/`. Evidence:
> `logs/RUN_LOG.md#2026-09-25`.
>
> `RUNNABLE-LIVE` is **not** claimed: live mode is unimplemented, gate 5 has no approval
> record, and no live, external, or model call has ever been made by this recipe.
> `attestation: null` because no human has recorded one — that is what `VERIFIED` requires.
>
> `todos_open: 2` counts real open items: the DEFINE on step 5's scoring constants and the
> APPROVE on gate 5. Both need a named human, not more code. Note when counting by grep that
> these marker strings also appear inside the gate 1 and gate 5 **test commands**, where they
> are part of the test, not open work.

## Purpose

Market Sentiment Analysis - Part 1 defines a Mycroft pipeline for collecting, transforming, or reviewing finance and intelligence signals related to market sentiment analysis - part 1. It answers whether the available local evidence and approved live sources are sufficient for a human decision without relying on unapproved external writes or unsupported analytical claims.

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Source | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ingest node outputs | JSON | Converted ingest steps (3 nodes) | Yes |
| Gigo node outputs | JSON | Converted gigo steps (1 nodes) | Yes |
| Tool node outputs | JSON | Converted tool steps (4 nodes) | Yes |

## Phase Gates

1. Source gate: All required source paths are present or explicitly marked with a typed TODO. Test: `test -f "recipes/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1.md" && rg -n "\[TODO: DEFINE]" "recipes/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1.md" || true`. Human capacity: [TO].
2. Scope gate: The run declares `sample` mode or an approved live mode before ingest begins. Test: `python3 -m json.tool data/raw/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1/run-envelope.json`. Human capacity: [PF].
3. Data-shape gate: Every raw and verified JSON output parses before downstream scripts run. Test: `find data/raw/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1 data/verified/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1 -name "*.json" -print -exec python3 -m json.tool {} \;`. Human capacity: [PA].
4. Script-readiness gate: Every one of the six step scripts exists and compiles. Test: `for s in tools/verify-provenance ingest/ingest-inputs gigo/validate-data-shape gigo/transform-quality-check tools/run-approved-tools tools/produce-human-report; do python -m py_compile "scripts/${s%%/*}/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-${s##*/}.py" || exit 1; done`. Human capacity: [IJ].
   Amended 2026-09-25: the original test passed if the script existed **or** if a DEV-TODO marker was still present anywhere in this recipe, so it could be satisfied by doing nothing. A gate with no failure path is not a gate.
5. Approval gate: Live network calls, external writes, credentials, production databases, emails, dashboards, publishing, or model calls with sensitive data require an approval record. Test: `test -f logs/gate-decisions/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-approval.json || rg --fixed-strings "[TODO: APPROVE]" "recipes/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1.md"`. Human capacity: [EI].
   [TODO: APPROVE] No approval record exists. Step 5 renders three live-call handoffs -- the Anthropic model call, Slack, and email -- all with `approved_for_live_action: false`, and none has ever run. Closure is a logged gate decision naming the approver, not a checkbox.
6. Report gate: Agent log and human report are written with the required fields and sections. Test: `test -f logs/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-[DATE].json && test -f reports/generated/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-[DATE].md`. Human capacity: [TO].

## Steps

1. Step name: Verify provenance. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/tools/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-verify-provenance.py`
   Status: Built and exercised. Input: optional `extra_paths` overrides. Output: the fields below plus `findings_digest` (timestamp-independent). Errors: a missing or unexpectedly-parseable required source is a hard stop with exit 1. Evidence: 11 deliberate break tests, `logs/RUN_LOG.md#2026-09-25`.
   Input: declared recipe inputs, prior step outputs, and gate decisions for `market-sentiment-analysis-part-1`.
   Output: workflow, source_paths, exists, parsed_ok, approval_state, checked_at.
   Where output goes: `logs/`
2. Step name: Ingest declared inputs. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/ingest/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-ingest-inputs.py`
   Status: Built and exercised. Input: `run-envelope.json` plus the fixture set it names. Output: the fields below, per source file. Errors: missing envelope, absent source, or live mode all stop with exit 1; live mode is unimplemented by design. Transports verbatim -- no recount, dedupe, drop, or coercion. Evidence: `logs/RUN_LOG.md#2026-09-25`.
   Input: declared recipe inputs, prior step outputs, and gate decisions for `market-sentiment-analysis-part-1`.
   Output: records, source_name, source_type, fetched_at, sample_mode, rejects.
   Where output goes: `data/raw/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1/`
3. Step name: Validate data shape. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/gigo/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-validate-data-shape.py`
   Status: Built and exercised. Input: a step-2 run directory. Output: the fields below. Errors: an unparseable file or malformed row is reported in full, then the run halts with exit 1. Detects 8 of the 18 catalogued corpus defects, in the fields the fixture manifest names. Evidence: `logs/RUN_LOG.md#2026-09-25`.
   Input: declared recipe inputs, prior step outputs, and gate decisions for `market-sentiment-analysis-part-1`.
   Output: record_count, required_fields_present, missing_fields, type_errors, parse_errors, schema_version.
   Amended 2026-09-25: `type_errors` added. A wrong-typed value was none of the five original fields, so corpus defects D02/D11/D17 had to be reported in step 4 `flags` as a workaround. Step 3 now reports them against the declared type contract; step 4 still carries them into `flags` for its quality assessment, the same way it already carries forward step 3 rejects.
   Where output goes: `data/verified/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1/`
4. Step name: Transform and quality check. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/gigo/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-transform-quality-check.py`
   Status: Built and exercised. Input: step-3 verified output. Output: the fields below. Errors: rejects or flags halt the run with exit 1 after reporting everything found. Detects the remaining 10 corpus defects; stale and wrong-typed rows are flagged and kept, never dropped or coerced. Evidence: `logs/RUN_LOG.md#2026-09-25`.
   Input: declared recipe inputs, prior step outputs, and gate decisions for `market-sentiment-analysis-part-1`.
   Output: verified_records, record_count, duplicates, rejects, flags, quality_notes.
   Where output goes: `data/verified/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1/`
5. Step name: Run approved tools. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/tools/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-run-approved-tools.py`
   Status: Built and exercised. Input: step-4 quality-checked output. Output: the fields below, per tool. Errors: a missing or unparseable input stops the run. Faithful port of the source workflow's scoring as `scoring_params v1.0.0`, emitting a named flag for every substitution it makes; model, Slack and email calls are rendered as handoffs and never executed. Evidence: `logs/RUN_LOG.md#2026-09-25`.
   Input: declared recipe inputs, prior step outputs, and gate decisions for `market-sentiment-analysis-part-1`.
   Output: tool_name, input_path, output_path, action_taken, approval_id, no_write_mode.
   [TODO: DEFINE] `scoring_params v1.0.0` -- the weights (price .4 / news .3 / social .3), the label thresholds (65/55/45/35) and both keyword lists are ported verbatim from the source workflow, which records no derivation, backtest, or author for any of them. They are reproduced so a historical score can be recomputed, NOT endorsed. Closure needs the values restated here with one sentence of reasoning, by a named human.
   Where output goes: `logs/`
6. Step name: Produce human report. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/tools/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-produce-human-report.py`
   Status: Built and exercised. Input: prior-step outputs. Output: the fields below, plus the report, the agent log, and a `*-audit.md` beside the data. Errors: a missing required report section stops the run with exit 1. Evidence: `logs/RUN_LOG.md#2026-09-25`.
   Input: declared recipe inputs, prior step outputs, and gate decisions for `market-sentiment-analysis-part-1`.
   Output: summary, sources_checked, gate_results, findings, typed_todos, next_decision.
   Where output goes: `reports/generated/`

## Output Contract

### Agent output
File: `logs/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-[DATE].json`
Fields: workflow, run_id, mode, steps_completed, records_seen, rejects, duplicates, flags, stop_conditions, todo_items, source_files, gate_decisions, generated_at, raw_output_paths, verified_output_paths, report_path.

### Human report
File: `reports/generated/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-[DATE].md`
Reader: compliance or audit reviewer who must be able to reconstruct exactly how any score was produced, and who accepts or blocks the run on that basis.
Amended 2026-09-25: previously "domain lead or human boss". The report already carries what reconstruction needs -- every source file with its SHA-256, the scoring parameters reproduced so a score can be recomputed by hand, and a per-score trace chain back to a raw locator -- so the stated reader now matches the artifact. A domain lead remains a valid secondary reader; the run summary and decision recommendation are written for them.
Decision enabled: approve the run for the next phase, request source/schema fixes, or block live execution.
Sections: run summary, purpose, source inventory, inputs used, phase-gate results, steps completed, records seen, rejects, duplicates, flags, typed TODOs, human approvals, verified findings, inferred findings, decision recommendation.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if credentials, API keys, database destinations, email addresses, or tokens are hardcoded instead of read from environment variables.
- Stop if live external calls, database writes, notifications, trades, or publication actions are requested without explicit human approval.
- Stop if required local source data is missing and no approved live-call path is available.
- Stop if generated outputs omit provenance or make unsupported analytical claims.

### Extracted Notes

Market Sentiment Analysis - Part 1 defines a Mycroft pipeline for collecting, transforming, or reviewing finance and intelligence signals related to market sentiment analysis - part 1. It answers whether the available local evidence and approved live sources are sufficient for a human decision without relying on unapproved external writes or unsupported analytical claims.

1. Source identity gate: Original workflow JSON exists and is the intended source. Test: `test -f "data/mycroft-main/n8n-workflows/originals/n8n_Workflows/Market_Monitoring_Agent/market_sentiment.json"`.
   Human capacity: [PF].
2. Input readiness gate: Every required input in this recipe exists or is marked with a typed TODO. Test: `rg -n "TODO:" /Users/bear/Documents/CoWork/bear-textbooks/books/mycroft/recipes/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1.md`.
   Human capacity: [PA].
3. Sample run gate: Ingest and tool steps run without live side effects before live mode. Test: `snickerdoodle run market-sentiment-analysis-part-1 --mode dialogic --sample`.
   Human capacity: [TO].
4. Data-shape gate: Raw and verified outputs parse as JSON where applicable. Test: `find data/raw/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1 data/verified/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1 -name "*.json" -print -exec python3 -m json.tool {} \;`.
   Human capacity: [IJ].
5. Report contract gate: Human report defines reader, decision enabled, and sections. Test: `rg -n "Reader:|Decision enabled:|Sections:" /Users/bear/Documents/CoWork/bear-textbooks/books/mycroft/recipes/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1.md`.
   Human capacity: [EI].

1. Step name: Verify provenance and source intent. Labor: Human.
   Human action: Record approval, rejection, or requested changes with supervisory capacity label [PF].
   Input: data/mycroft-main/n8n-workflows/originals/n8n_Workflows/Market_Monitoring_Agent/market_sentiment.json.
   Output: provenance fields: workflow_path, exists, parsed_ok, title_matches_pipeline, source_inventory_checked.
   Where output goes: logs/gate-decisions/.
2. Step name: Webhook Trigger. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/tools/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-webhook-trigger.py`

   Output: local handoff JSON fields: action, approved_for_live_action:false, input_refs, output_refs, flags, live_call_performed.
   Where output goes: logs/.
3. Step name: Parse Question & Extract Tickers. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: n/a -- NOT CARRIED FORWARD. No canonical step parses a user question. Step 5 derives the ticker from the price rows' `01. symbol` and raises the flag `ticker_not_derived_from_question`. The original defaulted a ticker-less question to `SPY`, silently turning it into an SPY analysis; that default cannot fire here because no question is scored at all.
   Input: approved upstream output or sample fixture.
   Output: verified JSON fields: record_count, records, rejects, duplicates, missing_fields, validation_flags.
   Where output goes: data/verified/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1/.
4. Step name: Fetch Price Data. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/ingest/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-fetch-price-data.py`
   Input: approved upstream output or sample fixture.
   Output: raw JSON fields: source_name, source_url_or_path, fetched_at, record_count, records, errors.
   Where output goes: data/raw/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1/.
5. Step name: Fetch News Headlines. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/ingest/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-fetch-news-headlines.py`
   Input: approved upstream output or sample fixture.
   Output: raw JSON fields: source_name, source_url_or_path, fetched_at, record_count, records, errors.
   Where output goes: data/raw/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1/.
6. Step name: Fetch Reddit Mentions. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/ingest/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-fetch-reddit-mentions.py`
   Input: approved upstream output or sample fixture.
   Output: raw JSON fields: source_name, source_url_or_path, fetched_at, record_count, records, errors.
   Where output goes: data/raw/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1/.
7. Step name: Aggregate & Calculate Sentiment. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: n/a -- ABSORBED BY STEP 5. Ported verbatim as `scoring_params v1.0.0`, including JavaScript `parseFloat`/`parseInt` semantics, with a named flag for every substitution the original makes.
   Input: approved upstream output or sample fixture.
   Output: local handoff JSON fields: action, approved_for_live_action:false, input_refs, output_refs, flags, live_call_performed.
   Where output goes: logs/.
8. Step name: AI Analysis & Synthesis. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: n/a -- ABSORBED BY STEP 5, as an approval-gated handoff. The prompt is rendered and the model id recorded; `approved_for_live_action: false` and no call is made. Requires gate 5 and a named approver.
   Input: approved upstream output or sample fixture.
   Output: local handoff JSON fields: action, approved_for_live_action:false, input_refs, output_refs, flags, live_call_performed.
   Where output goes: logs/.
9. Step name: Send to Slack. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: `scripts/tools/market-sentiment-analysis-part-1-send-to-slack.py`
   Input: approved upstream output or sample fixture.
   Output: local handoff JSON fields: action, approved_for_live_action:false, input_refs, output_refs, flags, live_call_performed.
   Where output goes: logs/.
10. Step name: Send Email. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: n/a -- ABSORBED BY STEP 5, as an approval-gated handoff. Never executed.
   Input: approved upstream output or sample fixture.
   Output: markdown report sections: run summary, source status, validation results, flags, typed TODOs, decision recommendation.
   Where output goes: reports/generated/.
11. Step name: Webhook Response. Labor: AI with Human gate.
   Script called: n/a -- NOT CARRIED FORWARD. This recipe's Output Contract is the agent log plus the human report; it has no webhook surface. Reinstating one would be a new step with its own gate.
   Input: approved upstream output or sample fixture.
   Output: markdown report sections: run summary, source status, validation results, flags, typed TODOs, decision recommendation.
   Where output goes: reports/generated/.
12. Step name: Produce human report. Labor: AI with Human review.
   Script called: n/a -- ABSORBED BY STEP 6, which writes the report, the agent log, and a `*-audit.md` beside the data.
   Input: agent log plus raw and verified outputs.
   Output: markdown report sections: run summary, source inventory, inputs used, validation results, flags, typed TODOs, decision recommendation.
   Where output goes: reports/generated/.
